# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-It was a good project to build a chess game in react it covers almoost all the topics that I have learned in the react I use the redux tool KIt in it to maintain the status and it was very tough to understand that how to make different rules for different moves then I take some help from the internet to learn how to make the rules of the chess and also I have added the move list in it which shows which moves are being played. Due to lack of other persons interest I build this project solo and  I enjoyed a lot this project
